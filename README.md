## Description
In this project I used Yfinance, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pathlib and pandas to create a 365 day (1 year) graphs of the closing 
prices for the stocks that are entered into the code with a trend line that is green if it is positive and red if its 
negitive. This code also will create a folder called charts where these charts will be saved to.
